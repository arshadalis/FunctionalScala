Value classes

we can create value classes in scala which has one public parameter and extends AnyVal
it can only have def s
class Wrapper(val in:Int) extends AnyVal

at compile time its type is Wrapper , but at run time its type is Int
it ignores the overhead of object creation and references
at runtime it doesnt actually creates Wrapper but Int is created

Allocation is necessary
1. when a value class is treated as another type
